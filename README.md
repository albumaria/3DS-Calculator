# 3DS-Calculator ðŸŽ®
## Basic calculator created using C and 3DS specific libraries, for the 3DS ! ðŸ˜Š

### Wanted to play around with the possibility of creating something for the 3DS console, and to test it out I've created this little calculator app.
All code is in the /source/main.c, and I've compiled it using the CMake file Makefile, to turn it into the runnable .3dsx file.
I've drawn all of the buttons myself, and the calculator itself is quite bad, but it was a fun experience - I was mostly interested in how rendering on two different screens was handled, and how to add graphical elements such as the buttons, which can be found in the /romfs folder.
